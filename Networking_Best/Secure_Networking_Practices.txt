Secure Networking Practices ‚Äì Essential Guidelines for Modern Networks
=====================================================================

1. Disable Unused Services and Ports
   - Always shut down interfaces or services not in active use.
   - Helps minimize attack surfaces and prevents unauthorized access.

2. Use Strong Authentication
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever supported.
   - For routers and switches, use TACACS+ or RADIUS instead of local passwords.

3. Encrypt All Management Access
   - Always prefer SSH over Telnet for remote access.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for device management.

4. Implement Network Segmentation
   - Separate user, management, and server networks using VLANs or firewalls.
   - Prevents lateral movement in case of a security breach.

5. Regularly Update Firmware and IOS
   - Keep network devices patched against known vulnerabilities.
   - Subscribe to vendor security advisories (Cisco, Juniper, etc.)

6. Enable Logging and Monitor Regularly
   - Send syslog messages to a centralized log server.
   - Regularly review authentication and connection logs.

7. Use Access Control Lists (ACLs)
   - Restrict access to critical network resources by IP or port.
   - Example: Allow SSH only from trusted management subnets.

8. Backup and Version-Control Configurations
   - Maintain periodic configuration backups.
   - Store securely with restricted access and version tracking.

9. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege
   - Limit admin rights to essential personnel.
   - Create read-only accounts for monitoring and audits.

10. Secure Physical Access
    - Lock down console ports and keep network devices in secure rooms.
    - Physical access = full control, so protect devices physically.
