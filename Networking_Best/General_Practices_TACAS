AAA / TACACS on a fresh box

If you configure AAA new-model and point it to TACACS servers before the box has working connectivity to those servers:

The router will try TACACS first for logins.

If it cannot reach the servers, and you haven’t configured a fallback method, you will be locked out of remote (SSH) and potentially even console access.

> Why console matters

By default, once you enable aaa new-model, the console line also uses AAA unless you explicitly configure a fallback (none or local).

That means: if TACACS is unreachable and no fallback is set → even the console will ask for TACACS auth → you’re stuck.

You’re safe to leave console pointing at local forever (best practice) and TACACS on vty lines.

Safe practice (before uplink is connected)

You can pre-configure AAA and TACACS safely if you:

Add a local fallback account:
username admin privilege 15 secret <YourStrongPassword>
aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local
aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ local

→ This way if TACACS is down/unreachable, the router falls back to local.

Protect console access explicitly (so you never lose it):
line con 0
 login authentication local

or even:
line con 0
 login local

→ This forces the console to always accept the local user account, regardless of TACACS.

Only enable VTY lines with TACACS after the uplink swap (optional safety step):

line vty 0 4
 login authentication default

you can configure AAA/TACACS before swapping cables as long as you set local fallback and keep the console on local auth. Otherwise, you risk losing even console access.
