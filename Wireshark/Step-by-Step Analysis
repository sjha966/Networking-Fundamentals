Open the PCAP file in Wireshark
	1. Load the File:
		○ Open Wireshark.
		○ Click File > Open and select your PCAP file.
2. Identify the TCP Handshake
	1. Filter for TCP Handshake:
		○ Use the display filter: tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
		○ This filter shows only the SYN packets which are the initial packets in a TCP handshake.
	2. Identify SYN-ACK and ACK:
		○ Look for the SYN-ACK packets using: tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 1
		○ Then, identify the final ACK of the handshake: tcp.flags.ack == 1 && tcp.len == 0
	3. Timestamp Extraction:
		○ Note the timestamps of these packets. The sequence for a complete TCP handshake is SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK.
3. Data Push and Session Establishment
	1. Filter for Data Packets:
		○ Use the filter: tcp.len > 0
		○ This filter shows packets containing data (i.e., not just ACKs).
	2. Session Establishment:
		○ The session is considered established once the handshake is complete and data packets start flowing. The timestamp of the first data packet can be taken as the session establishment time.
4. Session Termination
	1. Filter for FIN Packets:
		○ Use the filter: tcp.flags.fin == 1
		○ This shows the packets used to terminate the connection.
	2. Filter for RST Packets:
		○ Sometimes connections can be terminated abruptly using RST packets: tcp.flags.reset == 1
	3. Timestamp Extraction:
		○ Note the timestamps of the FIN or RST packets to determine when the session is being terminated.
5. Latency Analysis
	1. Round-Trip Time (RTT):
		○ Wireshark can calculate RTT for you. Right-click on a TCP packet and select Follow > TCP Stream. In the stream view, Wireshark will show you the RTT for each packet.
	2. TCP Stream Graph:
		○ Go to Statistics > TCP Stream Graph > Round Trip Time Graph to visualize the latency over time.
